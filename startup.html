                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Climbing is relatively simple to get started in, you don't need to be in amazing physical shape, nor even have much of a head for heights to start.</p>
                <p>There isn't a lot of equipment required to start climbing, basic gym clothing is fine for indoor climbing, with only really a pair of shoes needed, if you're curious you can hire from the local gym.</p>
                <p>While climbing is a highly regulated and controlled sport, there is still potential for injury, when starting a climbing gym you will need to be aware of the risks involved and sign a waver before climbing, if that doesn't put you off see below for the equipment you need to do the various climbing activities.</p>

            <div id="bouldering-1" class="startup-picture"><img src="assets/images/boulder_shoes.jpg"></div>
            <div id="bouldering-2" class="startup-text">
                <p>Bouldering is the climbing activity with the least amount of equipment required, it is now the most popular climbing activity in the UK, with many gyms offering bouldering only.</p>
                <p>Boulder gyms normally have 4 meter high walls with plastic holds, and crash padding below to break falls, there is no rope involed in bouldering.</p>
                <p>Regular gym clothing is perfectly adequate for indoor bouldering, although loose fitting clothing is unadvisable.</p>
                <p>The only dedicated climbing equipment needed is a pair of climbing shoes, there are many brands avalible, with popular ones being from Scarpa, La Sportiva and Reebok 5.10</p>
                <p>While you can hire shoes at a gym, it is recommended if you start to get into climbing to get a pair for yourself, they'll fit better and will have better rubber.</p>
                <p>While not strictly needed, chalk is highly recommended as well, as it absorbs sweat from the hand and impoves your grip onto the holds.</p>

            <div id="sports-climbing-intro" class="sub_intro"><h3>Sports climbing</h3></div>
            <div id="sports-climbing-1" class="startup-picture"><img src="assets/images/sports_climbing.jpg"></div>
            <div id="sports-climbing-2" class="startup-text">
                <p>Sports climbing used to be the most popular and conventional indoor climbing, only a small jump from bouldering.</p>
                <p>Additional equipment is needed for sports climbing, this is a rope and harness, and a device for belaying.</p>
                <p>Sports climbing is a two person activity, with one person climbing and the other person managing the rope at the bottom, a process known as belaying. In gyms, the rope is often attached at the top of the climb, with the rope being above the climber at all times. This means tha should a climber fall the rope will rapidly become tight. This is refered to as top rope climbing.</p>
                <p>A slightly more advanced version of sports climbing is when you take the rope up with you. This is known as lead climbing.</p>
                <p>Indoor lead climbing the climber will take the rope with them to fixed points every 1 to 2 meters apart with a device known as a quick draw on it. The climber will attach the rope to the draw each time they reach it, gradually taking the rope with them.</p>
                <p>Lead climbing gives a greater sensation of climbing without protection, it can definitely be the most nervy of the indoor climbing activities!</p>

            <div id="lead-climbing-intro" class="sub_intro"><h3>Outdoor lead climbing</h3></div>
            <div id="lead-climbing-1" class="startup-picture"><img src="assets/images/quickdraws.jpg"></div>
            <div id="lead-climbing-2" class="startup-text">
                <p>Outdoor climbing is often the ultimate goal for a lot of casual climbers, it requires the most equipment and pre-planning, the weather also plays a huge part!</p>
                <p>Outdoor lead climbing involves locating an area which has been setup for climbing, guide books for local areas are avalible and the routes will have gradings that you can match your own ability, it should be noted that outdoor climbs are often harder grades than the indoor counterparts.</p>
                <p>In addition to the equipment needed for indoor sports climbing, quickdraws will be required, as outdoor sports walls will be bolted but not have the capacity to attach a rope directly.</p>
                <p>Additionally a personal attachment system is highly recommended, this makes safely setting up a decender station at the top far easier.</p>
                <p>It is advisable to take someone who is experienced in outdoor climbing with you on your first time, there are also several companies who provide training for outdoor climbing, with the added bonus that these companies often climb in great outdoor spots!</p>
                <p>Beyond outdoor sports climbing there is outdoor Traditional (Trad) and mountaineering, but these shouldn't be attempted without a firm grasp of the previous climbing activties.</p>
