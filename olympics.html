                <div id="olympic-bouldering-2" class="olympic-content"><p>Bouldering is an event where the climber attempts to scale a number 4.5 meter high climbing problems. The climber has as many attempts as they can manage over a period of 3 minutes. Boulder problems are unique to the event, and the climber does not get to see the problem until they walk out to attempt to climb it. Working out how to climb the problem in the first place is a key part of the event! Climbers are graded by how few attempts they take to complete the problem, with a 'zone' hold about halfway through giving a half score should they fail to complete the project.</p></div>

Unlike speed climbing, lead climbing problems are unique to the event. Before the attempt the climber, along with their competators, has a short period of time to view the problem. The climber who gets the furthest up the wall in the shortest amount of time is the winner.</p></div>
